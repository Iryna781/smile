        text: "If you are looking to have the big-name ski resort experience without breaking the bank, Breckenridge is for you! With plentiful accommodation options at varied prices and endless shopping, dining and drinking spots, Breck can suit all budgets. In terms of the skiing, it is an awesome mountain to ride with close to 200 trails for all abilities and North America is highest lift! Whistler-Blackcomb, the largest ski resort in North America, ticks all the boxes for the ultimate ski holiday experience. You will be skiing for days exploring over 200 runs across two mountains that total 8,172 acres of skiable terrain! There is terrain to accommodate all levels as well as inbounds backcountry, bowls, glaciers, tree trails and five terrain parks! Vail has one of the most expensive walk-up lift tickets in the country and the town can feel slightly contrived compared to authentic towns like Breckenridge. Nonetheless, its infinite dining options, lodging, apres-ski activities and heated sidewalks make it a must-visit ski destination! Aspen rules the apr√®s-ski scene with endless dining and nightlife options! Its upscale reputation does come with a price tag, especially if you are looking for ski-in/ski-out accommodation. Traditional skiers can enjoy the mountain all to themselves, as those pesky snowboarders are not allowed at Alta! An expert paradise, Jackson Hole is known for the most continuous vertical in the US! One of Colorado well kept secrets, Telluride is located in a western town full of character. The difficulty in accessing Telluride comes at the benefit of keeping the crowds away and being a great place for beginners to learn on the wide, uncrowded runs. Squaw Valley is a favorite amongst the advanced, with wildly extreme terrain. The base village has tons of lodging, dining and shopping choices, but the convenient location from the Bay area draws big crowds. If luxury and pampering is what you are after, look no further than Beaver Creek! As Colorado newest resort, visitors can enjoy expertly groomed runs and efficient lift systems. With rustic western charm and almost no crowds, Steamboat is a must-visit among the larger US resorts. What makes this resort unique is having some of the best glade skiing in Colorado, and tree runs for all abilities! ",
